# ECE 297 Project

Contributor: Lanlin He, Noah Monti, Nicole Jiao

# Project Summary:
The goal of this project is to build a Geographic Information System (GIS) software program that will let you
visualize and solve travel and optimization problems in maps of any city of the world, which will be able to:

1. Read in a database of all the intersections and streets and other geographic features in a city
and organize it into appropriate data structures.
2. Draw the resulting map nicely and let the user interact (pan, zoom, highlight, search for
locations, etc.) with it.
3. Find good travel routes between intersections in the city and give directions to a user.
4. Find a good order of deliveries and a good driving path for a courier company driver to complete
his/her list of daily deliveries.


# Milestone Breakdowns:

 ### Milestone 1: 
 - Load data from API and store them into appropriate data structure.
 - Be able to answer simple queries 

 ### Milestone 2:
 - Rendor map (roads, transportations, POI, features , etc) and user interface using glade, ezgl and gtk.
 - Load different maps without recompilation.
  
### Milestone 3:
  - Find fastest route between any two intersection with A* algorithm.
  - Visualize route and provide directions.

### Milestone 4:
  - find route for many courier deliveries to minimize travel time with limited runtime.
  - Optimization with multithreaded simulated annealing, two-opt, etc.
